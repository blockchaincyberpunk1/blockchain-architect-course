Designing a Private Blockchain Network (Design Project)

Objective: Instruct students to design a private blockchain network.

Instructions:

Private blockchain networks are widely used in enterprise settings, offering controlled access and enhanced privacy compared to public blockchains. In this assignment, students will design a private blockchain network architecture tailored to address the specific needs of an enterprise use case.

Requirements:

Select an Enterprise Use Case:

Ask each student or group of students to choose an enterprise use case that can benefit from blockchain technology. Examples include supply chain management, document verification, or asset tracking.
Private Blockchain Network Design:

Instruct students to design a private blockchain network that suits the selected enterprise use case. They should consider the following aspects:
Number of Nodes: Determine the appropriate number of nodes (participants) in the network. Explain the rationale behind this choice.
Consensus Mechanism: Select a consensus mechanism suitable for a private blockchain. Common choices include Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) or Raft consensus. Justify the selection.
Privacy Measures: Describe privacy measures that ensure data confidentiality among participants. Consider techniques like zero-knowledge proofs or confidential transactions.
Data Structure: Specify the data structure for transactions and blocks. Explain how it accommodates the use case's requirements.
Smart Contracts: Decide whether smart contracts are necessary and how they will be utilized.
Node Permissions: Define the roles and permissions of network nodes (e.g., read-only nodes, validator nodes, admin nodes).
Security Measures: Outline security measures to protect against unauthorized access, data tampering, or other security threats.
Interoperability: If applicable, explain how the private network might interact with other networks (e.g., public blockchains, partner networks).
Architectural Diagrams:

Require students to create detailed architectural diagrams illustrating the components and interactions within the private blockchain network. Visualize the flow of transactions, consensus, and data privacy measures.
Security and Feasibility Analysis:

Ask students to conduct a security analysis of their design, identifying potential vulnerabilities and explaining how they plan to mitigate them.
Encourage students to assess the feasibility of their design by considering technical, regulatory, and operational factors.
Documentation and Justifications:

Instruct students to document their design choices, justifications, and how the design aligns with the chosen enterprise use case.
Assessment:

Evaluate the students' private blockchain network designs based on the following criteria:

Completeness: Assess whether the design covers all essential aspects of a private blockchain network, including consensus, privacy, security, and interoperability.
Justifications: Evaluate the quality of justifications provided for design choices, including node count, consensus mechanism, and privacy measures.
Feasibility Analysis: Consider the depth of the feasibility analysis and whether students have considered potential challenges and solutions.
Architectural Diagrams: Assess the clarity and quality of the architectural diagrams in illustrating the design.
Security Measures: Evaluate the effectiveness of security measures proposed to protect the network.
Documentation: Assess the quality of documentation and whether it effectively explains design choices and their alignment with the chosen enterprise use case.
