Implementation of Permissioned Blockchain (Coding Project)

Objective: Challenge students to implement a permissioned blockchain network.

Instructions:

Permissioned blockchain networks are designed for controlled access, making them suitable for various enterprise applications. In this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience by implementing a permissioned blockchain network using a blockchain framework such as Hyperledger Fabric or Quorum.

Requirements:

Select a Blockchain Framework:

Choose a blockchain framework that supports permissioned blockchain networks. Popular choices include Hyperledger Fabric, Quorum, or Corda.
Setup and Configuration:

Instruct students to set up the chosen blockchain framework on their development environment. They should configure the necessary components, such as ordering nodes, peer nodes, and membership services.
Explain the importance of access control and the need for proper identity management within permissioned networks.
Permissioned Nodes:

Assign students the task of creating multiple permissioned nodes (participants) in the network. Each node should have a distinct identity.
Instruct them to configure access permissions, defining which nodes can participate in transactions and smart contracts.
Access Control Rules:

Require students to establish access control rules that determine which nodes can read and write data on the blockchain ledger.
Encourage them to consider role-based access control (RBAC) and fine-grained access control to meet specific use case requirements.
Transaction Demonstration:

Instruct students to demonstrate transactions within the permissioned blockchain network. They should initiate transactions, record them on the ledger, and verify that access control rules are enforced.
Documentation:

Ask students to document the setup process, configurations, access control rules, and transaction demonstrations in a detailed report.
Assessment:

Evaluate the students' permissioned blockchain implementations based on the following criteria:

Setup and Configuration: Assess the completeness and accuracy of the blockchain framework setup and configuration.
Permissioned Nodes: Check if students have successfully created multiple permissioned nodes with distinct identities.
Access Control Rules: Evaluate the effectiveness of the defined access control rules in regulating node participation.
Transaction Demonstration: Ensure that students can initiate transactions within the network and that access control rules are enforced.
Documentation: Assess the quality and completeness of the documentation, which should provide clear instructions and explanations of the implemented permissioned blockchain network.
