Blockchain Platform Comparison (Research and Presentation)

Objective: Compare and contrast different blockchain platforms.

Instructions:

In this assignment, students will explore and analyze various blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Binance Smart Chain, or other popular options. The goal is to create a comparative presentation that provides a detailed comparison of these platforms, including their features, consensus mechanisms, and development languages. By undertaking this task, students will gain a deeper understanding of different blockchain technologies and be better equipped to make informed decisions when selecting a platform for specific projects.

Requirements:

Platform Selection:

Assign students to research and analyze multiple blockchain platforms. You can provide a list of platforms to choose from or allow them to select platforms of interest.
Research and Analysis:

Instruct students to conduct comprehensive research on their chosen blockchain platforms.
Encourage them to delve into various aspects, including but not limited to:
Platform features and capabilities.
Consensus mechanisms and their implications.
Development languages and tools supported.
Community and ecosystem surrounding the platform.
Notable projects and use cases built on the platform.
Presentation Content:

Require students to create a presentation that covers the following areas for each blockchain platform they analyze:
Platform overview, including its history and objectives.
Core features and strengths.
Consensus mechanism(s) and their significance.
Development languages and tools.
Pros and cons of the platform.
Examples of real-world projects or applications built on the platform.
Comparison and Decision Factors:

Encourage students to include a section where they compare the analyzed platforms.
Discuss the factors that one should consider when selecting a blockchain platform for a particular project or use case.
Include insights on which platform might be most suitable for different types of applications.
Presentation Format:

The presentation can be in the form of slides, videos, or other media, depending on students' preferences and the course's format.
Delivery:

Students should deliver their presentations in class, virtually, or through pre-recorded videos, depending on the course setup.
Assessment:

Assess the presentations based on the depth of analysis, clarity, and the ability to provide valuable insights for decision-making when choosing a blockchain platform.
