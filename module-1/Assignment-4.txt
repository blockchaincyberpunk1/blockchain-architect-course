Blockchain Use Case Analysis (Presentation)

Objective: Explore real-world applications of blockchain technology.

Instructions:

In this assignment, students will delve into real-world applications of blockchain technology by analyzing specific use cases. Each student or group of students will be assigned a particular blockchain use case, such as supply chain, healthcare, or finance. Their task is to prepare a presentation that thoroughly discusses the use case, elucidating how blockchain technology can address challenges or provide innovative solutions within that context. This assignment aims to enhance students' ability to identify and analyze blockchain opportunities in various industries.

Requirements:

Use Case Assignment:

Assign each student or group a specific blockchain use case. You can provide a list of predefined use cases or allow students to choose from a set of options.
Research and Analysis:

Instruct students to conduct in-depth research on their assigned use case, focusing on the current challenges and opportunities within that industry.
Encourage them to explore how blockchain technology can be applied to address those challenges or provide novel solutions.
Students should provide examples and case studies that highlight existing implementations or pilot projects related to their use case.
Presentation Content:

Require students to create a presentation that covers the following aspects:
Overview of the assigned use case, including key challenges.
