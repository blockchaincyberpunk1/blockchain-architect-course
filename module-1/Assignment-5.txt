Exploring Blockchain Types (Research and Report)

Objective: Familiarize students with different types of blockchains and their characteristics.

Instructions:

In this assignment, students will explore and compare different types of blockchains: public, private, and consortium. They will conduct research to understand the unique characteristics, advantages, and common use cases of each blockchain type. The goal is to provide students with insights into when and where each type is most suitable.
