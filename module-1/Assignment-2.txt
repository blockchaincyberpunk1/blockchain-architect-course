Blockchain Network Design

Objective: Design a blockchain network for a specific use case, considering various architectural components and consensus mechanisms.

Instructions:

In this assignment, students will take on the role of a blockchain architect and design a blockchain network tailored to a specific use case. They will need to consider various architectural components, consensus mechanisms, and network requirements to create an effective and efficient blockchain solution.

Requirements:

Use Case Selection:

Assign each student a specific use case for which they will design a blockchain network. Examples of use cases include supply chain management, healthcare data sharing, or digital identity verification.
Blockchain Network Design:

Instruct students to design a blockchain network that addresses the requirements of their chosen use case. They should consider the following aspects:
Network architecture: Public, private, consortium, or hybrid blockchain.
Consensus mechanism: Select an appropriate consensus mechanism (e.g., proof of work, proof of stake, or others) based on the use case's requirements.
Data structure: Describe how data will be structured in blocks and transactions.
Smart contracts: Determine if smart contracts are needed and explain their functionality.
Governance model: Define the governance model for the blockchain network, including roles and responsibilities.
Scalability and performance: Address scalability issues and propose solutions.
Security considerations: Outline security measures to protect the blockchain network.
Interoperability: Discuss how the blockchain network will interact with external systems or other blockchains.
Presentation or Report:

Ask students to present their blockchain network design to the class or prepare a comprehensive report. The presentation or report should include visual aids (e.g., diagrams or charts) to illustrate the network's architecture and components.
Peer Review:

Encourage students to provide feedback on each other's designs. Peer review can help refine the blockchain network designs and foster collaboration among students.
Assessment:

The blockchain network design assignment will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Relevance to Use Case: Does the blockchain network design align with the requirements and challenges of the chosen use case?

Architectural Components: Are the chosen blockchain architecture, consensus mechanism, and other components appropriate for the use case?

Clarity and Detail: Is the design well-documented and explained with clarity? Are visual aids used effectively?

Feasibility and Scalability: Is the proposed blockchain network feasible and scalable for the given use case?

Security: Are security considerations adequately addressed in the design?

Interoperability: Is there a plan for interoperability with external systems or blockchains if needed?
