Deploying Smart Contracts (Hands-On)

Objective: Familiarize students with deploying smart contracts on different platforms.

Instructions:

In this assignment, students will gain practical experience deploying the same smart contract on multiple blockchain platforms. By comparing the deployment processes, they will develop a better understanding of the nuances between different blockchain ecosystems.

Requirements:

Smart Contract Selection:

Provide students with a specific smart contract (e.g., a token contract) that they will deploy across multiple blockchain platforms.
Platform Selection:

Instruct students to choose at least two different blockchain platforms for deployment. Examples include Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and others.
Deployment Process:

Task students with documenting the entire deployment process for each selected platform. They should include the following steps:
Setting up the development environment for each platform.
Writing any platform-specific code or adjustments required.
Deploying the smart contract on each blockchain.
Interacting with the deployed contracts (e.g., sending transactions).
Any challenges or differences encountered during deployment.
Comparison:

Ask students to write a detailed comparison of their deployment experiences across the chosen platforms.
They should highlight key differences, similarities, and any challenges faced during deployment.
Encourage students to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each platform for smart contract deployment.
Submission:

Require students to submit a comprehensive document or report that includes:
Documentation of the deployment process for each platform.
A clear comparison of the experiences, challenges, and observations.
Any code or configuration files used during deployment.
Assessment:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:

Documentation Quality: Is the documentation of the deployment process clear, detailed, and well-organized?
Comparison Clarity: Did students provide a clear and insightful comparison of their deployment experiences on different platforms?
Observations: Did students accurately identify and explain differences and challenges encountered during deployment?
Insights: Did students offer meaningful insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each blockchain platform for smart contract deployment?
