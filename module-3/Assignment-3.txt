Custom Smart Contract Development (Project)

Objective: Encourage students to design and deploy their custom smart contracts.

Instructions:

In this project-based assignment, students will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge of smart contract development by designing, coding, and deploying a custom smart contract that addresses a real-world use case. This assignment will enable them to gain practical experience in creating smart contracts that align with specific business or industry needs.

Requirements:

Use Case Selection:

Allow students to choose a use case for their smart contract project. Examples of use cases include but are not limited to:
Decentralized voting system
Supply chain management
Tokenization of assets (e.g., real estate, art, or commodities)
Gaming or gambling applications
Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols
Identity management and authentication
Smart Contract Design:

Instruct students to design their smart contract based on the chosen use case. They should consider the following aspects:
Contract state variables
Functions and methods
Events for logging important contract actions
Security measures and access control
Any additional functionality specific to their use case
Smart Contract Development:

Task students with writing the Solidity code for their custom smart contract. They should adhere to best practices in smart contract development.
Encourage them to consider security considerations, gas efficiency, and reusability of their code.
Deployment and Testing:

Instruct students to deploy their smart contract on a blockchain network of their choice. They can choose a public testnet like Rinkeby or a local development environment.
Encourage them to thoroughly test their smart contract's functionality and security.
Documentation:

Require students to provide comprehensive documentation for their smart contract, including explanations of contract features, methods, and any special considerations.
Presentation:

Ask students to prepare a presentation in which they explain their use case, the design of their smart contract, and how it addresses the chosen problem.
Encourage them to present their code and contract interactions during the presentation.
Assessment:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:

Smart Contract Completeness: Is the smart contract fully functional and capable of addressing the chosen use case?
Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, adhering to best practices, and free from vulnerabilities?
Documentation: Did students provide clear and comprehensive documentation for their smart contract?
Presentation: How effectively did students present their use case and smart contract design during the presentation?
Use Case Relevance: Does the smart contract effectively address the chosen real-world use case?
