Scalability Challenges Discussion (Group Presentation)

Objective: Encourage students to explore scalability challenges in blockchain.

Instructions:

In this assignment, students will work in groups to investigate and discuss various scalability challenges that blockchain technology faces. Scalability is a critical issue for blockchain networks, as it directly impacts their ability to handle a large number of transactions and users. By researching and presenting on these challenges, students will gain insights into the complexities of blockchain scalability.

Requirements:

Group Formation:

Divide the class into groups, with each group focusing on a specific scalability challenge. Examples of challenges include transaction throughput, network latency, and blockchain storage.
Research and Analysis:

Assign each group the task of researching their selected scalability challenge. Instruct them to explore academic papers, industry reports, and blockchain projects that address the challenge.
Encourage groups to provide a detailed explanation of the problem, including its technical aspects and real-world implications.
Proposed Solutions:

Task each group with proposing potential solutions or strategies to mitigate the selected scalability challenge. Solutions can involve consensus algorithm improvements, sharding techniques, off-chain scaling, or any relevant approach.
Encourage groups to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each proposed solution.
Presentation Preparation:

Instruct each group to create a well-structured presentation summarizing their findings. Presentations should include:
An introduction to the scalability challenge.
An explanation of its impact on blockchain networks.
An overview of proposed solutions.
An analysis of the feasibility and effectiveness of these solutions.
Visual aids (e.g., diagrams, charts) to enhance understanding.
Group Presentation:

Allocate a specific class session for group presentations. Each group should have a designated time to present their findings and engage in a Q&A session with the class.
Assessment:

Evaluate the group presentations based on the following criteria:

Content Quality: Assess the depth and accuracy of the research conducted by each group.
Clarity and Communication: Review the clarity of explanations and the effectiveness of communication during the presentation.
Proposed Solutions: Evaluate the feasibility and relevance of the proposed solutions.
Engagement: Consider the level of engagement and participation during the Q&A session.
Visual Aids: Assess the use of visual aids to enhance understanding.
