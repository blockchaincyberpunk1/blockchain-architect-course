Integration with Legacy Systems (Integration Project)

Objective: Teach students how to integrate blockchain with legacy systems.

Instructions:

Integrating blockchain technology with legacy systems is a complex yet crucial aspect of blockchain architecture. In this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience by designing and implementing an integration solution that bridges a legacy system with a blockchain network.

Requirements:

Legacy System Selection:

Provide students with access to a specific legacy system. The legacy system can be a centralized database, an enterprise application, or any other legacy technology.
Blockchain Network:

Ensure that students have access to a blockchain network for this assignment. You can use a local blockchain emulator or a testnet.
Integration Solution:

Assign each student or group of students the task of designing and implementing an integration solution that connects the legacy system with the blockchain network.
Instruct them to consider the following aspects when designing their integration solution:
Data synchronization: How will data be transferred between the legacy system and the blockchain, ensuring consistency and accuracy?
Authentication and access control: How will users and the legacy system authenticate and interact with the blockchain?
Data flow: How will data flow between the legacy system and the blockchain? What triggers or events will initiate data transfer?
Implementation:

Encourage students to implement their integration solutions using appropriate technologies and programming languages. For example, they might use APIs, middleware, or smart contracts for integration.
Provide guidance and resources on how to establish connections between the legacy system and the blockchain.
Documentation:

Task students with creating comprehensive documentation that explains their integration solution. The documentation should include:
An overview of the legacy system and the blockchain network.
Detailed step-by-step instructions on how to set up and configure the integration components.
Code samples or snippets showcasing the integration implementation.
Explanations of how data synchronization, authentication, and data flow are managed.
Testing:

Require students to test their integration solution thoroughly to ensure that data synchronization and authentication processes work as intended.
Presentation:

Ask students to present their integration solutions to the class. They should explain their design choices, implementation details, and demonstrate how data flows between the legacy system and the blockchain.
Assessment:

Evaluate the students' integration solutions based on the following criteria:

Effectiveness: Assess whether the implemented integration solution successfully connects the legacy system with the blockchain network, ensuring data synchronization and authentication.
Adherence to Best Practices: Check whether students follow best practices for integration and security.
Documentation Quality: Review the completeness and clarity of the documentation, ensuring that it provides sufficient instructions and explanations.
Testing: Verify that the integration solution has been thoroughly tested and functions as expected.
Presentation: Consider the quality of the presentation, including how well students communicate their design choices and implementation details.
