Contribution to Open-Source Blockchain Projects (Coding or Documentation Contribution)

Objective: Challenge students to actively participate in open-source blockchain projects, gaining practical experience and making meaningful contributions to the blockchain community.

Instructions:

In this assignment, students will have the opportunity to contribute to open-source blockchain projects. Open-source contributions are valuable for both personal growth and the blockchain community as a whole. Students can choose from a range of contributions, including coding improvements, bug fixes, documentation updates, or feature suggestions.

Requirements:

Project Selection:

Instruct students to identify and choose a suitable open-source blockchain project to contribute to. They can select from well-known projects like Ethereum, Hyperledger, or any other blockchain-related open-source project of their interest.
Contribution:

Task students with making a meaningful and documented contribution to the selected project. Contributions can include but are not limited to:
Coding Improvements: Fixing bugs, optimizing code, or implementing new features.
Documentation Updates: Improving project documentation, writing tutorials, or clarifying existing documentation.
Feature Suggestions: Proposing new features or enhancements with a well-structured rationale.
Documentation of Contributions:

Students must provide clear evidence of their contributions. Depending on the nature of their contribution, this may include:
For coding contributions: Providing links to code commits, pull requests, or patches.
For documentation contributions: Showing before-and-after examples of documentation changes.
For feature suggestions: Explaining the proposed feature and its potential benefits.
Assessment:

Evaluate students' contributions to open-source blockchain projects based on the following criteria:

Impact: Assess the significance of the contribution within the context of the selected project.
Quality: Evaluate the quality of the code, documentation, or feature suggestion.
Documentation: Ensure that students provide clear evidence of their contributions.
Community Feedback: Consider any feedback or response from the open-source project's maintainers or community.
