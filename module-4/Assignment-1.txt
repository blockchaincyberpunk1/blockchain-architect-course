Blockchain Architecture Analysis (Research and Report)

Objective: Explore different blockchain architectural patterns.

Instructions:

In this assignment, students will conduct in-depth research on various blockchain architectural patterns. They will write a comprehensive report that explores the differences between public and private blockchains, permissioned and permissionless networks, and multi-chain solutions. This assignment encourages students to analyze real-world use cases and assess the advantages and disadvantages of each architectural pattern.

Requirements:

Research Topics:

Assign students to investigate the following blockchain architectural patterns:
Public Blockchains vs. Private Blockchains
Permissioned Networks vs. Permissionless Networks
Single-Chain vs. Multi-Chain Solutions
Use Case Examples:

Instruct students to provide real-world examples and use cases for each architectural pattern. These examples should illustrate how each pattern is applied in different industries or scenarios.
Analysis of Pros and Cons:

Task students with analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of each architectural pattern. They should consider factors like scalability, security, decentralization, and governance.
Report Writing:

Ask students to compile their research findings and analysis into a well-structured report.
The report should include clear headings, subheadings, and citations for sources used.
Assessment:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:

Research Depth: Did students thoroughly research and analyze the selected blockchain architectural patterns?
Use Case Illustration: Did students provide compelling real-world examples and use cases for each pattern?
Analysis Quality: Did students offer a well-rounded analysis of the pros and cons of each architectural pattern?
Report Clarity: Is the report well-organized, well-written, and free from grammatical errors?
