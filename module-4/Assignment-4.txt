Multi-Chain Solution Design (Project)

Objective: Encourage students to design a multi-chain solution for a complex use case.

Instructions:

In this assignment, students will tackle the challenge of designing a multi-chain solution for a complex use case that requires interoperability between multiple blockchain networks. They will have to consider data flow, cross-chain communication, and security aspects in their design. The goal is to give them experience in architecting solutions that leverage multiple blockchains to address intricate real-world problems.

Requirements:

Complex Use Case Assignment:

Assign students a complex use case that demands the use of multiple blockchain networks. Examples include interoperable supply chain management, cross-border payments, or multi-chain identity management.
Multi-Chain Solution Design:

Task students with designing a multi-chain solution that integrates at least two distinct blockchain networks. They should choose from public, private, permissioned, or permissionless blockchains, depending on the requirements of the use case.
Instruct students to consider how data will flow between chains, how different chains will interact, and how smart contracts or other technologies will enable cross-chain communication.
Architectural Diagrams:

Require students to create architectural diagrams that illustrate the components, data flow, and communication pathways of their multi-chain solution.
The diagrams should clearly depict the interaction between different blockchains and any middleware or bridge solutions used for interoperability.
Detailed Explanations:

Ask students to provide detailed explanations for their multi-chain solution. This should include a written report that describes the architecture, the role of each blockchain, and the rationale behind their design choices.
Encourage them to discuss how security and data privacy concerns are addressed in the multi-chain setup.
Assessment:

Evaluate students' multi-chain solutions based on the following criteria:

Completeness: Assess whether the proposed multi-chain solution comprehensively addresses the complexities of the assigned use case.
Feasibility: Evaluate the feasibility of the design in practical terms. Is it implementable with existing technology and standards?
Interoperability: Examine how well the different blockchain networks interact with each other and whether cross-chain communication is well-defined.
Data Flow: Assess the clarity and efficiency of data flow between the various chains.
Security: Consider how security and data privacy concerns have been addressed in the design.
