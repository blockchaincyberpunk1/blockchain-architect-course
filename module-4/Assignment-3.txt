Developing a Simple DApp (Hands-On)

Objective: Give students practical experience in designing and developing decentralized applications (DApps).

Instructions:

In this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience in designing and developing a decentralized application (DApp) that interacts with a blockchain network, such as Ethereum. The objective is to provide them with practical exposure to DApp development by creating a simple yet functional application. Students will be assigned a basic use case and will need to design the DApp's smart contracts and user interface, deploy it on a testnet, and provide comprehensive documentation and code samples.

Requirements:

Use Case Assignment:

Assign students a basic use case for the DApp. Examples include a voting application, a decentralized auction, or a simple token-based system. Ensure that the use case is suitable for beginners.
Smart Contract Development:

Instruct students to design and develop the smart contracts required for the DApp using Solidity (or any other relevant smart contract language).
Encourage them to consider security best practices when writing smart contracts.
User Interface (UI) Development:

Task students with creating a user-friendly UI for the DApp. They can use web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the front end.
The UI should allow users to interact with the smart contracts (e.g., submit votes, place bids) in a straightforward manner.
Deployment on a Testnet:

Guide students through the process of deploying their DApp on a blockchain testnet (e.g., Rinkeby for Ethereum). They should deploy both the smart contracts and the UI.
Documentation and Code Samples:

Require students to provide detailed documentation that explains how to interact with their DApp. This should include clear instructions for using the UI and interacting with the smart contracts.
Ask students to submit code samples of both the smart contracts and the UI.
Assessment:

Evaluate students based on the following criteria:

Functionality: Assess the functionality of the DApp. Does it work as intended, and does it fulfill the requirements of the assigned use case?
Security: Evaluate the security of the smart contracts. Did students follow best practices to minimize vulnerabilities?
User Experience: Assess the user interface for usability and user-friendliness.
Documentation: Evaluate the quality and comprehensiveness of the documentation provided.
Code Quality: Assess the quality of the code, including readability and adherence to coding standards.
